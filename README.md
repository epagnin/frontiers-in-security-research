This is a **6.5hp credits PhD-level course** held by LTH. The courses are *seminar-style*, so each participant will hold 1 or 2 ‘seminars’ and actively participate to all other seminars.

## Course Calendar
One seminar a week

    (this needs to be done at least 2 weeks before your seminar slot)
2. Get an approval for your choice by me.
3. Upload the information about your seminar to this github page.
4. Prepare a 45 minutes presentation on the work you selected. 
5. Prepare a quiz to assess your peers' learning of your topic.
6. Get my approaval for the quiz you designed and upload it to mentimeter. 
    (send the quiz to me at least 3 days before the seminar)

## Seminar Structure
**Introduction** - this should be high level and accessable to anyone, set the paper into a context and perspective
**Main Contributions** - presented in a way that any graduate studnet can understand the impact of the work
**Technical Details** - in depth explanation of some parts of the work
**Critical Summary** - personal take on the paper and its contributions

### Learning Assesment 
To make sure you come prepared to the seminars and to train the presenter's abmility to assess learning via quizzes, you will have to solve a quiz for every seminar.

### Quiz Instructions

Among of the goals of both courses there are:
* Learn yow to recongnize good papers;
* Exercise your presenter’s skills, both to a general/introductory level and towards more technical/detailed jeargon; 
* Train your capacity to discuss and pose interesting research questions in fields ‘around’ your main area of expertise;
 * Expand your horizons in terms of research areas;
 * Get to know what are the current hot topics and interesting challenges in security-related;
* Start challenging yourself on how to assess others' learning (via quizzes);

## Credit Calculation
**1hp credit** for the weeks you give the seminar
*(this corresponds to about 3 full days of effective work, concretely 25 yours preparing and 2 hours attending the seminar)*
**0.5hp credit** for the qeeks you attend seminars 
*(this corresponds to almost 2 full days of work, so you are supposed to spend around 10 hours studying the paper and preparing for the seminar, and 2 yours for attending)*
