# frontiers-in-security-research
This is a **7.5hp credits PhD-level course** held by LTH. The course is in *seminar-style*: each participant will hold 1 or 2 seminars and actively participate in all other seminars. For quality assessment there are several additoinal tasks entailed with each seminar.

## Course Calendar
One seminar a week

### Schedule
Date, time: speaker - paper title (link to paper, link to report)

## General Insturctions
0. You select one paper from a top conference. Be sure to pick a work you find interesting and that has important contribution
1. Write a one-page **report/review** on the paper _(see instructions below)_ 
2. Send the paper, your report and a short summary of **why** you chose this work to me (Elena) _(this needs to be done at least 2 weeks before your seminar slot)_
2. Get an approval for your choice by me. _(if this does not arrive within 2 days, send me a reminder)_
3. Upload the information about your seminar to this github page _(this includes the time/date of the seminar; speaker's name, the paper's title, author list and venue; and the report)_
4. Prepare a **45 minutes presentation** on the work you selected
5. Prepare a **quiz** to assess your peers' learning of your topic
6. Get my approaval for the quiz you designed and upload it to mentimeter _(send the quiz to me at least 3 days before the seminar)_
7. Deliver the seminar :) be active in the discussion afterwards and reflect on the feedback you receive

#### Criterias On How To Select A Paper
The paper must be **accepted for publication** in one of the **major conferences in the field no earlier than 2 years ago** 
(e.g., you can pick a paper that appeared at CRYPTO18, CRYPTO19 and CRYPTO20, but not from 2017 or before). 

Conferences that are OK by default are: 
CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT, ASIACRYPT, PKC, TCC, CT-RSA, IEEE S&P, PETs, CHES.

If you wish to present a paper from a different venue contact me with a valid argument and I may make an exception.

## Seminar Structure
**Introduction** - this should be high level and accessable to anyone, set the paper into a context and perspective

**Main Contributions** - presented in a way that any graduate student can understand the impact of the work

**Technical Details** - in depth explanation of some parts of the work

**Critical Summary** - personal take on the paper and the importance of its results

### Learning Assesment 
To make sure you come prepared to the seminars and to you will have to answer a quiz for every seminar. In addition, the speaker needs to provide a report on the chosen paper, and each attendee needs to provide a short feedack on each report and seminar. 

### Quiz Instructions
* The quiz should have **7 multiple choice questions**.
* The first 3 questions will be worth 2 points and should be of a more general character.
* The last 4 questions are worth 1 point eah and go deeper into the paper.

### Learning Objectives
* Learning how to recongnize good papers;
* Training your ability to assess learning via quizzes;
* Exercising your presenter’s skills, both to a general/introductory level and towards more technical/detailed jeargon; 
* Training your capacity to discuss and pose meaningful research questions in fields ‘around’ your main area of expertise;
* Expanding your horizons in terms of research areas, hot topics and open challenges;
* Improve your abilities of giving and receiving feedback;
* Starting to challenge yourself with how to assess others' learning (via quizzes).

### Writing the Report
The structure of your report shouold be similar to a paper review: 
- summary of the paper's contributions
- importance of the presented results in the field
- what is good about it
- what is bad or could be improved
The report is expected to be around **1 page long**.

### Feedback
For every seminar, half of the students will give a written feedback on the speaker's report, the other half gives a written feedback on the oral presentation. 

## Credit Calculation
**1.5hp credit** for preparing and giving a seminar 
*(this corresponds to a full week of work: 25 hours preparing for the presentation; 3 hours for quiz-related tasks; 10 hours for writing a report; and 2 hours for attending the seminar)*

**0.75hp credit** for preparing for, attending and giving feedback to a seminar 
*(this corresponds to almost 3 days of work: 12 hours studying the paper, preparing for the quiz and the post-seminar discussion; 5 hours for writing feedback; 1 hour to reflect on your feedback/the feedback you receive; and 2 yours for attending the seminar)* 


## Passing The Course
Attend and give enough seminars to gain 7.5 credits:

* 1.5 + 0.75x8 = 7.5 (1 seminar given, 8 seminars attended) -> 9 students or more (at least 9 weeks ~ spread over 3 months)

* 2x(1.5 + 0.75x3) = 7.5 (each student gives 2 seminars) -> 4 students or more (at least 8 weeks ~ spread over 2 or 3 months)
